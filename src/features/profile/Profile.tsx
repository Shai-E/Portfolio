        <p>
          A highly motivated developer. These past two years Iâ€™ve focused on front end with React and React Native. I
          study constantly on Udemy and love to experience and overcome challenges in code. I started my way as a youth
          counselor, became a teaching assistant, then a teacher. I believe I am a great team worker, a quick learner
          and I strive for excellence in everything I do.
